0.10.1(h1):
- Fix compatibility with later Streamline 1.x versions.
This fixes crashes on launch for TLOU, TW3, Bright Memory Infinite, etc.
- Fix swapchain ref-counting on creation.
This fixes the semi-random Starfield crash on launch.
- Properly handle input resource changes during execution.
This fixes some games crashing when using dynamic resolution, and might improve other game crashes as well.
- Reduce overhead of replace_dlss_fg and use_game_upscaling modes.
This should improve performance a bit when using these modes.
- Specify correct HUDless resource state in Cyberpunk 2077
May fix/remove certain artifacts on specific AMD GPUs.

Additional Changes in Hotfix 1:
- Fix completely broken Streamline 1.x support.

IMPORTANT NOTE: I messed up the mode values in these early 0.10 versions. here are the fixed versions:
enable_upscaling_only -> enable_game_only
use_game_upscaling -> use_builtin_upscaling
