0.10.3:
- Make Resolution and Sharpness overrides also apply to `use_game_upscaling` and `replace_dlss_fg`.
Now these settings will also work with DLSS and XeSS in these modes. 
As XeSS does not come with a normal sharpening pass, this is implemented using a custom CAS pass after upscaling is performed.
- Added a log message stating if and which functions a game calls that may allow for the use of resolution overrides.
Only really applies to FSR/XeSS, as most/all games using DLSS support resolution overrides
- Blacklist reactive mask in Horizon: Zero Dawn
Improves image quality when using any mode that upscales using FSR.
- Added a `default-fsr2fsr3.config.toml` to the common files which has explanations for each config setting.
- Added a `disable_console` config setting that disables the console on startup. 
This is only meant for handheld users, as it makes checking the log at runtime more difficult.
