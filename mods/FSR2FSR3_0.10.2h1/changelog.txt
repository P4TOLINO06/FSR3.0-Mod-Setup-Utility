0.10.2:
- Fix config mode names to reflect their actual names.
You don't need to update your configs if you are using the broken names, they will get fixed when launching the game automatically.
- Add new compatibility config setting  `fake_nvapi_results` - Setting this to true makes NvAPI report that the system is using a 40-series GPU
This is only relevant for GTX series users and even then only for a very tiny fraction of games, but if you had issues with DLSS/FG not being selectable before this might fix it
- Make `fake_nvidia_gpu` also apply to systems where a NVIDIA gpu is already present
Before this wasn't the case, meaning that it didn't have any effect on systems running 10/20/30-series and older GPUs.
- Move `fake_nvidia_gpu` to the compatibility section
- Make config update to the latest format automatically when launching with a newer build

- **Further fix cases where invalid resources are provided to FSR3.** 
HZD and RDR2 should now work again on systems with an AMD GPU, without the issues that they had in the previous working 0.9 release.
- Fix issues relating to switching between borderless and exclusive fullscreen modes, as well as changing resources during gameplay
This might resolve crashes when performing any of these operations. 

Hotfix 0.10.2h1 fixes the following issues:
- Fixed the config file not reading the correct fake GPU property.
