0.9.0:
Game-related improvements:
- Add support for non-RGB color formats in FSR3.
This fixes Starfield support.
- Improve handling for games that provide invalid resources to FSR.
This fixes the HZD crash on launch on AMD, as well as the RDR2 crash.
- Add support for FSR2 versions without a name field.
I've seen this "optimization" technique in a few games now, but particularly in RDR2.
Adds support for RDR2 with its specific FSR2FSR3 build.
- Disable ID3D12InfoQueue1 callback as its not used anyways
This caused a crash in some old versions of streamline. Destroy all Humans 2 now works.
- Blacklist HUDless resource from being used in Dying Light 2
Its broken. (Thanks to Nukem for initially finding this issue.)

Config-related improvements:
- Add config option to disable Frame Generation
- Add config option to override in-game Sharpness value

Miscellaneous improvements:
- Add hooks for Reflex streamline plugin and report compatibility
This makes Atomic Heart no longer disable DLSS-FG on launch.
- Remove ref-counting in macOS compatibility mode.
macOS can't count, for some reason, and this fixes the mod crashing on various games that didn't use streamline.
