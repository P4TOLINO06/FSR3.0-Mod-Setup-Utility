##To enable setting set value after the "=" to true, to disable - to false or 0.
[Main]

## Untie the game speed from the framerate.
#
UntieSpeedFromFPS=true

## Enable to disable the iFPSClamp game option, which will otherwise interfere with the mod.
#
DisableiFPSClamp=true

## Enable or disable vertical sync (VSync). Enabling ForceVSync in ENB will overwrite this setting.
#
#  IMPORTANT: If you are using borderless windowed mode and want to disable VSync, AllowTearing must be set to true.
#
#  Note: This option overrides 'iVSyncPresentInterval' in Fallout4Prefs.ini.
#
EnableVSync=true

## Required for disabling V-Sync in borderless/windowed mode. Only works with a flip SwapEffect option.
#
#  More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/variable-refresh-rate-displays
#
#  WARNING: Disable this if you have ENB installed and ForceVSync is set to true in enblocal.ini, otherwise your game may freeze on startup.
#
AllowTearing=false

## Enable for reduce loading time (effect is especially noticeable if game is on SSD).
#
#  Disables vertical sync on loading screens. 
#  ForceVSync=true in ENB will overwrite this setting (so be sure to set ForceVSync=false in enblocal.ini if you want to use this feature).
#
DisableVSyncWhileLoading=true

## Enable for remove black loading screens. Reduce loading time.
#
DisableBlackLoadingScreens=false

## Enable for SIGNIFICANTLY reduce loading time (up to two times faster than other settings). The settings can be combined with each other.
#
#  Disables animation on loading screens. FPS counter will be frozen.
#  Effect is especially noticeable on black loading screens.
#
DisableAnimationOnLoadingScreens=false

## Allows to reduce the time of the post-loading animation when moving between locations.
#
#  Also useful for Quickload (especially during battle).
#  The default in the game is 1, for a two-fold reduction - 2, a three-fold - 3, and so on.
#
PostloadingMenuSpeed=1.0


[Limiter]

## FPS limit in the game.
#
InGameFPS=0.0

## Separate FPS limit in exteriors and interiors.
#
ExteriorFPS=0.0
InteriorFPS=0.0

## FPS limit on loading screens. (only applies if "DisableVSyncWhileLoading" is set to true).
#
#  EnableFPSLimit=true in ENB will overwrite this setting (so be sure to set EnableFPSLimit=false in enblocal.ini if you want to use this feature).
#
LoadingScreenFPS=350.0

## FPS limit during lockpicking. Uses for fix lockpicking sound.
#
LockpickingFPS=60.0

## FPS limit in Pip-Boy - for example 60.
#
#  Helps to normalize animation speed in Pip-Boy if you are using FallUI mod.
#
PipBoyFPS=0.0

## The number of processor threads used when starting a new game. Helps to fix bugs of some quests, for example 'Emogene Takes a Lover'.
#
NumOfThreadsWhileLoadingNewGame=1

## Determines if the limiter is placed before or after frame presentation.
#
#  Placement can affect performance when a framerate limit is being imposed.
#
#  0 - before (favor consistent frametimes)
#  1 - after  (favor input latency)
#
FramerateLimitMode=0


[Display]

## Select the display mode.
#
#    true  - Exclusive fullscreen mode
#    false - Windowed mode
#
#  Note: This option overrides 'bFull Screen' in Fallout4Prefs.ini if uncommented.
# 
Fullscreen=false

## Select windowed or borderless windowed mode. Only applies when Fullscreen=false.
#
#    true  - Borderless windowed mode
#    false - Windowed mode
#
#  Note: This option overrides 'bBorderless' in Fallout4Prefs.ini if uncommented.
#
Borderless=true

## Stretch game window across the entire screen in borderless fullscreen mode.
#
#  Use with a flip SwapEffect option for best results.
#
#  Note: For optimal performance and full feature support when upscaling, your 
#        system must have windowed hardware composition support (check the log).
#        Windowed hardware composition only works with flip.
#
BorderlessUpscale=false

## Disable swap chain buffer resizing on window resizing. Enable if you are having problems with ENB.
#
ResizeBuffersDisable=false
ResizeTargetDisable=false

## The number of buffers in the swap chain. Allowed values are from 1 to 8. Value 0 - automatic determination of the required value.
#
# More information: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dxgi/nf-dxgi-idxgiswapchain-resizebuffers.
#
BufferCount=0

## Determines how the presentation buffer is handled.
#  
#  Options starting with 'flip_' indicate DXGI flip model, a relatively new feature which greatly improves borderless
#  fullscreen performance. While testing I couldn't notice any difference in performance compared to exclusive fullscreen mode.
#  In contrast, the old presentation model suffers lower FPS and noticeable stuttering. Additionally, many features which used
#  to require exclusive fullscreen now work in borderless. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that G-Sync works without having
#  to enable it for windowed mode.
#
#  WARNING: Don't use flip model in exclusive fullscreen mode, the game might freeze on start.
#
#  Valid options: 0 - automatically choosing the best setting, 1 - discard, 2 - sequential, 3 - flip_sequential, 4 - flip_discard.
#
#  More information: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dxgi/ne-dxgi-dxgi_swap_effect and https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/dxgi-flip-model.
#
#  It's recommended to leave this on auto as the best option will be selected based on detected capabilities.
#
#  Note: Flip model requires at least Windows 8.1 (only flip_sequential supported), but I highly recommend Windows 10 Spring 
#        Creators update or later if you want the best experience.
#
SwapEffect=0

## Determines how the image is stretched in exclusive full screen mode to fit the monitor resolution.
#
#  Valid options: 1 - unspecified, 2 - centered, 3 - stretched.
#
ScalingMode=1


[Fixes]

## Enable this to fix a drop in disk read speed during boot screens. Reduces loading times.
#
#  Especially reduces the time of black loading screens.
#
#  ATTENTION: the setting works only if the value of the setting 'LoadingScreenFPS' is greater than 0, do not set too high values.
#

[Window]

## Locks mouse cursor within the borders of the game window.
#
#  Fixes the invisible runaway mouse glitch plaguing people with multiple monitors who keep a window
#  open on the neighboring monitor and it keeps scrolling while playing the game.
#
LockCursor=true

## Minimize the game window if it loses focus.
#
#  Useful in borderless fullscreen mode if alt-tabbing just pushes the game window to the background
#  instead of minimizing it.
#
#  WARNING: Avoid using this with ENB or ReShade, things might break when alt-tabbing.
#
ForceMinimize=false

## Disables the window ghosting feature.
#
#  Useful in windowed/borderless/borderless fullscreen mode.
#
#  Read more: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-disableprocesswindowsghosting
#

## Automatically center the game window on the monitor where it spawns.
#
#  Useful in windowed mode.

[Papyrus]

## Set the maximum time scripts are allowed to run per cycle based on current framerate.
#
#  Normally scripts are given a fixed max. amount of execution time per cycle controlled by
#  fUpdateBudgetMS - 1.2 ms by default, roughly 7% of each cycle at 60 FPS, 17% at 144, 29% at
#  240, .. The higher your framerate, the harder it gets to sustain it under heavy script load.
#
#  This attempts to even things out by adjusting the limit based on time it took to complete 
#  the previous cycle. Less budget is alloted at higher framerates.
#
#  Formula:
#
#    fUpdateBudgetMS = lastCycleTime * (UpdateBudgetBase / 16.66667)
#
#  Note: fUpdateBudgetMS never goes above UpdateBudgetBase (see below).
#
DynamicUpdateBudget=false

## Amount of time scripts are alloted at or below 60 FPS (in milliseconds).
#
#  Recommended to leave at default. If you use a different fUpdateBudgetMS value in Fallout4.ini,
#  set the same here.
#
#  Bethesda default: 1.2
#
UpdateBudgetBase=1.2

## Budget is not calculated beyond this limit.
#
#  Set this at or above your maximum framerate.
#
#  At 144 minimum budget is 0.5 ms, 0.3 ms at 240.
#
#  Valid range: 60 - 300
#
BudgetMaxFPS=240

## Enable to display fUpdateBudgetMS value in OSD.
#
OSDStatsEnabled=false


[Miscellaneous]

## Disables scanning missing plugin .ini files. May significantly improve startup times with many plugins.
#
#  By default the engine looks for every single .ini option for each installed plugin, without checking
#  if the .ini file actually exists. Massive waste of time and resources, especially when the user has a
#  heavily modded game.
#
#  Note: This is unrelated to the PrivateProfileRedirector plugin and is fully compatible with it. If you
#        use it alongside that plugin the difference won't be felt, but it still prevents the CPU from doing
#        a bunch of useless work at startup.
#
SkipMissingPluginINI=true
