0.7.4 (beta):
- Add support for pre 2.0 sl.interposer versions, you should now be able to enable DLSS-FG in these games to improve/fix HUD ghosting (Dying Light 2, The Witcher 3, maybe more)
- Add support for custom resolution overrides through the config.
With this you can customize the applied scaling for the FSR2 or DLSS presets, which you could use to enable DLAA/Native/1x scaling on games that do not normally have this option.
It should work the same as in DLSSTweaks.
- Correctly spoof hardware capabilities for old interposers.
HAGS is now no longer required in games that needed it previously.
- Fix the GPU proxy not working under specific circumstances where Streamline proxying was used by the game.
Should remove the dependency on the old dxgi.dll proxy some games had (Dying Light 2)
