0.7.6 (beta):
- **Fix certain major scene transitions causing hangs/crashes.**
This **fixes cutscene crashes in The Last of Us Part I**, and might fix some crashes in various other games as well.
- Make FSR context handling more robust and add logic to support multiple upscaling contexts.
This fixes the cutscene crashes in Jedi Survivor, but those will run without FG being active for now.
Might fix other games that create/destroy multiple DLSS/FSR contexts during gameplay, mainly UE games.
- Add `macos_crossover_support` config option for macOS-specific compatibility tweaks.
Some more games should launch with this option being set to true, but there is no fake GPU support for this at the moment.
