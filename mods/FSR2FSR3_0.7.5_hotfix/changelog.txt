0.7.5 (beta):
- Fix device proxy config accidentally being inverted (false == on, true == off)
- Add new way of loading NVNGX that does not rely on any nvngx.dll files in the game directory
This might not work in all games (though it should in most), and the old way is still (somewhat) supported
Just delete all _nvngx.dll and nvngx.dll files in the game directory after updating to this version.

0.7.5 (beta) hotfix:
- Fixed The Witcher 3 compatibility
- Added a check to no longer hook into crs-handler.exe
